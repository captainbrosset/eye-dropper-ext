# EyeDropper browser extension

A simple browser extension that makes it possible to grab colors from the entire screen, and store them locally for later reuse.

This extension is built using the new [EyeDropper API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EyeDropper_API) which is supported in Chromium-based browsers (96+).
